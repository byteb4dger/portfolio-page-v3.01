I like winter and cool temperatures. I enjoy listening to Lo-Fi music, which accompanies me throughout the day. I always enjoy revisiting The Office (Creed is the best character!) even if I've watched the entire series a hundred times. Additionally, I enjoy cycling trips, a healthy lifestyle, and vacations on the forgotten Greek islands.
